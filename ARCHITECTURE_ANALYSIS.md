## 🧠 **Temporal Processing: No LSTM, But Smart Alternatives**

### **Instead of LSTM, the system uses:**

#### **1. 🪟 Sliding Window Analysis**
```python
# Velocity calculation using sliding windows
self.window_size = 16
self.overlap = 8
self.velocity_windows = []
self.acceleration_windows = []
self.velocity_sequence = []
```
- **Purpose**: Captures temporal patterns without neural networks
- **Method**: Overlapping windows for velocity & acceleration analysis
- **Window Size**: 16 frames with 8-frame overlap for smooth temporal analysis

#### **2. 🧠 Memory-Based Smoothing**
```python
# Multiple memory systems for different purposes
self.prediction_memory = []                    # 5-frame memory
self.prediction_memory_velocity = []           # 16-frame velocity memory  
self.state_transition_sequence = []            # 40-frame state tracking
self.aspect_ratio_memory = []                  # 4-frame aspect ratio tracking
```
- **Purpose**: Temporal consistency without recurrent networks
- **Method**: Multiple circular buffers for different time scales
- **Smart Smoothing**: Prevents false positives from single-frame anomalies

#### **3. 🔄 Finite State Machine (FSM)**
```python
def get_finite_states(self):
    return {
        'stand-sit': {'fall': 0, 'end_episode': 0},
        'stand-sit-lie': {'fall': 2, 'end_episode': 1},
        'stand-lie': {'fall': 2, 'end_episode': 0},
        'lie-sit-lie': {'fall': 2, 'end_episode': 1},
        # ... more state transitions
    }
```
- **Purpose**: Models temporal transitions between postures
- **Method**: Rule-based state transitions with fall detection logic
- **Advantage**: Interpretable and reliable without training data

## 🔬 **Fuzzy Logic System (Not Neural Networks)**

### **Aspect Ratio Membership Functions:**
```python
def aspect_ratio_membership(self, aspect_ratio):
    # Linear membership functions for 7 categories
    return [low, low_medium, medium_low, medium, 
            medium_high, high_medium, high]
```

**Categories Mapped to Postures:**
- `low` → **Standing** (narrow bounding box)
- `medium` → **Sitting** (moderate aspect ratio)  
- `high` → **Lying** (wide bounding box)

**This is classical fuzzy logic, NOT neural fuzzy systems**

---

## 📈 **Rule-Based Prediction Logic**

### **Main Prediction Function (No ML Models):**
```python
def predict_pose(features=[], features_df=None):
    # Pure rule-based logic using if-else statements
    if feature_list['stand_left'] == 'standing' and feature_list['stand_right'] == 'standing':
        label = 'stand'
    elif feature_list['percent_upright'] < 20 and ... :
        label = 'lie'
    # ... more rule-based logic
```

**Key Insight:** The entire prediction system uses **hand-crafted rules** based on:
- Joint angle thresholds
- Body orientation percentages
- Aspect ratio classifications
- Multi-criteria decision logic

---

## ⚙️ **Temporal Analysis Methods**

### **1. Velocity & Acceleration Tracking**
```python
# Calculate velocity using sliding windows
initial_window = self.velocity_windows[:self.window_size]
current_window = self.velocity_windows[self.overlap:]
velocity = np.array(current_window_diff) - np.array(initial_window_diff)
```

### **2. Sequence Smoothing**
```python
# Ensure velocity sequence consistency (no zero-crossing)
if np.all(col > 0) or np.all(col < 0):
    valid_velocity = velocity[i]
else:
    valid_velocity = 0  # Filter out noisy transitions
```

### **3. Multi-Scale Memory**
- **Short-term** (4-5 frames): Smoothing predictions
- **Medium-term** (16 frames): Velocity analysis  
- **Long-term** (40+ frames): State transition tracking
